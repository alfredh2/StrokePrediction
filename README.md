# Patient Stroke Prediction

## Overview

This project aims to predict whether a patient is at risk of having a stroke using logistic regression and additional K-Means clustering analysis. The model has achieved a true positive rate of over 90%, making it a reliable tool for early detection of stroke risk.

## Features

1. **Logistic Regression Model**: Utilizes the scikit-learn library to predict stroke occurrences.
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Additional analysis to segment patient groups and identify high-risk clusters.
3. **Visualization**: Includes visualizations of the data and model performance.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Preprocess the data using the provided scripts or Jupyter notebooks.
    - Ensure the data is clean and properly formatted for model training.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Train the logistic regression model by running the appropriate notebook or script.
    - Save the trained model for future use.

3. **Model Evaluation**:
    - Evaluate the model performance using the test dataset.
    - Analyze the results and visualize the performance metrics.

4. **Clustering Analysis**:
    - Perform K-Means clustering to segment patient groups.
    - Analyze the clusters to identify high-risk groups.


## Results

- The logistic regression model achieved a test ROC AUC of 0.78.
- K-Means clustering identified high-risk patient groups, providing insights for targeted medical interventions.
